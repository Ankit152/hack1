Question:
You are given n activities with their start and finish times. Select the maximum number of activities that can be performed by a single person,
assuming that a person can only work on a single activity at a time.

Solution (In python):
s=list(map(int,input().split()))
f=list(map(int,input().split()))
n = len(f)
# The first activity is always selected
i = 0
print(i)
# Consider rest of the activities
for j in range(n):
    # If this activity has start time greater than
    # or equal to the finish time of previously
    # selected activity, then select it
    if s[j] >= f[i]:
        print(j)
        i=j
